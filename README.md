**Introduction**

QSTN provides a decentralized solution for businesses to fund surveys using smart contracts on the Solana blockchain. This guide explains how to set up, deploy, and interact with the QSTN survey smart contracts.

**Prerequisites**

To run, test, or deploy this smart contract, make sure you have everything necessary to run the project on Anchor installed. You can find all the necessary instructions for setting up the Anchor environment [here](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/installation).

**Installation**

Clone the repository and navigate to the contracts directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/QSTN-US/Solana-QSTN-v2.git
cd Solana-QSTN-v2/CONTRACTS/qstn-survey-native
yarn
anchor build
anchor test
```

**Contract Overview**

This repository contains solana program (smart contract) designed for creating and funding surveys. Key components include:

lib.rs: Main program for creating and managing surveys.
qstn-survey.ts: Test cases of survey contract using and security tests.

The lib.rs program allows users to create surveys, fund them, and manage survey data. Key functions include:

```rust
init_survey(
ctx: Context<InitSurvey>,
survey_id: u64,
survey_uuid: String,
controller: Pubkey,
participants_limit: u64,
reward_amount: u64,
)
```

`init_survey` is used to initialize the PDA instance for a new survey. In the ecosystem, this function is called by a business user who creates a new survey.

```rust
fund_survey(ctx: Context<FundSurvey>, amount: u64, fee: u64)
```

`fund_survey` is used to fund the newly created survey with native currency, which will be used as a reward for users who take the survey. Additionally, a portion of the funds is allocated as compensation for the manager's expenses to automate the reward payouts to users.

```rust
payout(ctx: Context<PayoutReward>, zkp_claim: String)
```

`payout` is used to distribute rewards to a specific user. This function can only be called by the manager. It accepts a ZKP hash to confirm the payout and stores it.

```rust
emergency_withdraw(ctx: Context<EmergencyWithdraw>)
```

`emergency_withdraw` is used for the emergency withdrawal of funds from the survey to the wallet of the user who created the survey.

**Deploying the Contracts**

Follow these steps to deploy the contracts on the Solana blockchain:

% anchor build
% anchor deploy

**Examples**

Creating and Funding a Survey
Here’s an example of creating and funding a survey using the @solana/web3.js:

```typescript
const program = new Program(QstnSurveyIDL as Idl, programId, { connection });

let [surveyAccount] = await anchor.web3.PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync(
  [
    Buffer.from("survey"),
    userAccount.toBuffer(),
    new anchor.BN(suid).toArrayLike(Buffer, "le", 8),
  ],
  program.programId
);

let [fundingAccount] = PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync(
  [Buffer.from("vault"), surveyAccount.toBuffer(), userAccount.toBuffer()],
  program.programId
);
```

```typescript
const transaction = await program.methods
  .initSurvey(
    new anchor.BN(ts),
    surveyUuid,
    controller,
    new anchor.BN(usersAmount),
    new anchor.BN(rewardAmount)
  )
  .accounts({
    surveyAccount: surveyAccount,
    fundingAccount: fundingAccount,
    caller: userAccount,
    systemProgram: anchor.web3.SystemProgram.programId,
  })
  .transaction();

const transactionSignature = await sendTransaction(transaction, connection);
```

```typescript
const transaction = await program.methods
  .fundSurvey(
    new anchor.BN(rewardAmount * usersAmount),
    new anchor.BN(feeAmount)
  )
  .accounts({
    surveyAccount: surveyAccount,
    fundingAccount: fundingAccount,
    caller: userAccount,
    controller: controller,
    systemProgram: anchor.web3.SystemProgram.programId,
  })
  .transaction();

const transactionSignature = await sendTransaction(transaction, connection);
```
